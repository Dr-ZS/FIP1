Fushuma Improvement Proposals (FUMAIPs)
Fushuma Improvement Proposals (FUMAs) are technical documents describing the changes proposed to the Fushuma protocol. Once finalized and approved by the core developers, volunteer client developers, implementers, and other users of Callisto Network, proposals are implemented by the core developer team.
Each proposal will be reviewed and discussed by the core and volunteer developers of Fushuma and any developers willing to contribute their motivated opinions.
Contributing
To submit a proposal, you can clone the repository and add your FUMA. A FUMA template is available here. Then submit a Pull Request to Callisto Network’s FUMAs repository.
FUMA status terms
•	Idea - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the FUMA Repository.
•	Draft - The first formally tracked stage of a FUMA in development. A FUMA is merged by an FUMA Editor into the FUMA repository when properly formatted.
•	Review - A FUMA Author marks a FUMA as ready for and requesting Peer Review.
•	Last Call - This is the final review window for an FUMA before moving to FINAL. A FUMA editor will assign the Last Call status and set a review end date (last-call-deadline), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes, it will revert the FUMA to Review.
•	Final - This FUMA represents the final standard. A Final FUMA exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.
•	Stagnant - Any FUMA in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An FUMA may be resurrected from this state by Authors or FUMA Editors by moving it back to Draft.
•	Withdrawn - The FUMA Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed FUMA. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this FUMA number. If the idea is pursued at later date, it is considered a new proposal.
•	Living - A special status for FUMAs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes, most notably, FUMA-1.
FUMA Types
FUMAs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of FUMAs.
Standard Track
Describes any change that affects most or all Fushuma implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Callisto Network.
Standard FUMAs can be broken down into the following categories:
•	Core: Improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions.
•	Networking: Improvements to networking protocol specifications.
•	Interface: Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo, and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before a FUMA is submitted to the FUMAs repository.
•	ERC: Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.
•	Meta: Describes a process surrounding Fushuma  or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process FUMAs are like Standards Track FUMAs but apply to areas other than the Fushuma protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Fushumas codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational FUMAs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Fushuma development. Any meta-FUMA is also considered a Process FUMA.
Informational
Describes a Fushuma design issue or provides general guidelines or information to the Fushuma community but does not propose a new feature. Informational FUMAs do not necessarily represent Fushuma community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational FUMAs or follow their advice.
Fushuma FUMA Contribution Rewards
To encourage innovation and constructive dialogue within the community, Fushuma is introducing a reward scheme for the most valuable contributions to the Fushuma Improvements Proposals (FUMA). The Fushuma Treasury will grant the rewards.
The rewards structure is as follows:
Outstanding Comprehensive Contribution - $300
This reward is granted to the contributor who provides an exceptional and comprehensive contribution to an existing FUMA.
To qualify, a contribution should include:
•	A detailed analysis of the proposal
•	Comprehensive feedback
•	Alternative solutions (if applicable)
Insightful Critical Analysis - $150
This reward is granted to the contributor who provides an insightful and valuable critical analysis of an existing FUMA.
To qualify, a contribution should include:
•	A description of the potential challenges
•	Areas for improvement
•	Impact analysis
Extra Reward - $50
This reward is awarded for the contribution that, in addition to providing a detailed analysis or proposal, outlines a practical implementation strategy for the proposed change.
Participation Rules:
•	Contributions are accepted from the "Draft" up to the "Last Call" stages.
•	All contributions and proposals must be original. Any plagiarism will result in disqualification.
•	Only the most insightful, detailed, and outstanding contributions will be considered for rewards.
•	The decision for reward allocation is solely at the discretion of the FUMA editors.
•	Rewards are paid in FUMA, equivalent to the stated USD amounts.
•	Authors of rewarded contributions will be announced on the respective FUMA when the proposal reaches its 'Final' stage.
